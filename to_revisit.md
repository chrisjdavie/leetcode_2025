### Got right

#### l_0080_remov_duplicated_from_sorted_array_ii - x
2025/03/24
- got order of operations wrong
- did the wrong thing with range
- solution can be much more elegant

2025/04/03
- solved it correctly

----------------

### To revisit

#### l_0088_merge_sorted_array
2025/03/23
- didn't get solution first time
- errors in coding
- - typos
- - not thinking correctly about exit conditions

2025/04/24
- although I got it right before running it, 2 mistakes during writing
- - got an equality the wrong way round
- - forgot to decrement the indicies

#### l_0169_majority_element
2025/04/24
- didn't go for the obvious solutions
- didn't go for the solution I knew, nerd sniped myself
- didn't know Moore's voting algorithm (fine, but know now)

#### l_0150_rotate_array
2025/04/26
- didn't go for obvious solution
- took me a while to understand the in place solution
- got some details in the place solution wrong

#### l_0055_jump_game
2025/04/27
- basically everything
- didn't read the instructions carefully, and it all went wrong

#### l_0055_jump_game_ii
2025/04/27
- didn't twig the obvious algorithm

#### l_0274_h_index
2025/04/27
- got the O(1) memory and O(NlogN) time solution, but missed the
hashmap solution that is O(N) time and O(N) memory

2025/05/03
- got the solution fast, but really screwed up coding it well
